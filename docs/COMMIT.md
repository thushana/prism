# Commit Message Style

## Format

```
ALL CAPS SLUG - Brief description of the feature succinctly
```

## Rules

- **ALL CAPS** slug (short, descriptive keyword)
- Single dash separator
- Brief explanation covering all unstaged changes in the commit
- One line only

## Examples

- `METADATA - Add global hover state to structure view for metadata display`
- `IMAGES - Resolve image display issues in evaluation builder`
- `DATABASE - Add Drizzle ORM with SQLite setup and database scripts`
- `UI - Simplify homepage to "Project" and remove unused public assets`

## Guidelines

- Commit should include all related unstaged changes
- Slug should be a single word or short phrase (e.g., `SETUP`, `DATABASE`, `UI`)
- Description should be concise but descriptive enough to understand the change
